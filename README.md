AutomationSystem
================
Summary

Use MQTT broker and client to post and get messages that home automation hardware need to perform tasks.  The database (mysql) will use all CRUD operation to store information about the zones (ex: room in house), control devices (ex: arduino's, raspberry pi's and servers) and sensors/IO (ex: temp, PIR, Relay).  This project will also include a mapping system to lay out the location of zones, control devices, and sensors/IO.  Also, it will have a platform to host the code need to run the control devices needed.
